                            <p> In this episode of Dark Souls 3 PvP Weapons I delved into the mysterious world of one of my favorite weapons in the Souls -series: Butcher Knife. How good is it really? Let's find out! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6mIG3Hnx0M. So recently I've fallen in love with this weapon and decided to bring back my weapon analysis series that I haven't done since Bloodborne. Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUZTvtg2ig Your trigger warnings: strong language, double D's, phallus symbols. I should first say that I'm not new to the Dark Souls pvp, I've played a little bit in Dark Souls 1 and for a long time in Dark Souls 2. Now Dark Souls 3 brought a different PvP-feeling to the table, one that I found sort of odd. I'll go over my experience with parrying at the end. I am only going to cover those weapons that I've actually done multiple hours of PvP with. The Straight Swords I've been using are the Irithyll Straight Sword and the Lothric Knight Straight Sword. Ultragreatswords. 
In your opinion what do you think the most effective weapon is in dark souls 3 PVP setting there are many effective weapons in the game but it comes down to how you want to play and how good you are so what are your all time favorite pvp weapons. What do you think are the best weapons in both PVP and PVE? This includes the DLC weapons. Now Dark Souls 3 has a shitload of weapons, so it can be hard to choose something that's both decent AND fun to use. Many weapons are overlooked due to appearing non meta and I'm here today to prove otherwise. For the sake of brevity I will be examining 3 weapons: #The Drang Twinspears Most people immediately dismiss these due to their lackluster damage but in doing so forget the essence of Souls game weapons: THE MOVESET. Motherfuckers, if you have dismissed the twinspears you haven't looked. Shown from the livestream earlier today: Giant Door Shield, Lothric Banner, Lightning Arrow (Miracle), Ringed Knight Straight Sword, Dragon Shield and Projected Heal (Miracle) ampnbsp; - Footage (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCGX3RFRK7I) ampnbsp. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMGu9_UMGBI Unbelievable, but the Notched Whip seemed to be not only viable, but it felt top tier weapon 
Good guide pls like men))) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kT0DnItVeg). So I've put in a number of hours into both Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 (as well as all of the other From Software games) and the first thing I noticed getting into these games is that I become VERY attached to my weapons. In Dark Souls 1 I picked up the Zweihander at the start of the game and didn't put it down, in Bloodborne it was the Kirkhammer, and so on. Through multiple run-throughs I have branched out and have found many more weapons I love through all of these games. Something Title https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC2SiaQ5mj4ampab_channel=Gnathorn Downside is that this particular weapon which I use to counter Quick step weights an unneccessary amount of weight. But still I think it works well enough. Would you have guessed which it is? Have you ever seen ANYONE even use it? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX7mWt8i44Iampab_channel=Gnathorn. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9xt9p0HvQoampfeature=youtu.be I've been doing so much math on three of the same weapons, but different infusions. My questions are basically this: How is damaged reduced? Is it Flat damage then %Absorption? If that's the case: If Charcoal Resin grants +85 Fire Elemental damage and your Elemental Flat damage resistance is 161, is the damage useless? Are infused weapons calculated behind two blankets of defense? Physical then Elemental? here's my info Someone please correct me I thought infusions were good for PVP Based. So here's the video, hope you'll enjoy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaSip2bB7zs A little background: So I made this video around 6 months ago and in this video I used the song "I'd Love to Change the World". It was my first video so I didn't give it too much thought copyright wise. so the video was up for sometime, I posted it here when I uploaded it, and after a couple of days the video got taken down. so today (around 6 months later) I realized I can just replace the original audio. Howdy everyone, just thought I'd share my video with you guys. It's a short little Strength weapons pvp montage, that showcases a variety of different weapons. I've always loved strength weapons in dks, they always seem to be the underdog, but boy can they pack a punch if your opponent does not watch themselves. I make my videos to inspire and spark creativity in the community, and I certainly hope you all enjoy!! Strength Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxQROcC0VVw My Channel/ </p>
