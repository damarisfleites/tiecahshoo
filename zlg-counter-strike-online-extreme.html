Being a 27 year old guy who's been aware of, or obsessed with, my phimosis for around 15 years I wanted to share some thoughts and details, in the hope that it helps people who are just starting out. ## Initial discoveries My family were later than most to switch from dial-up to broadband. When I finally got my own computer at around 13 years old, I was swept up in a frenzy of Miniclip, Newgrounds, Counter Strike, Limewire, MSN messenger, and endless pornography.

For those that love this game as it is and don't think it needs any changes, you probably won't care to read what I am going to write here, just being honest here so you don't waste your time as it is a long read.

#Overview Link to BATTLE post from Winter 2025-2026 (https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/bg00fl/battle_the_rain_in_bhutan/) China has inserted itself so far in between the border of India and Bhutan, aiming to drive a wedge between India and its historic ally. Succeeding will mean that Chinese-Bhutan relations will take place under the looming spectre of Chinese hegemony, reversing a century of India enjoying that privilage over the diminuative state. India has guaranteed Bhutanese. Скачать CS 1.6 Здесь. Все материалы зжаты в программе WinRAR.

Why does the game not explain any of the mechanics?? amp#x200B; Sudden Death/ Tempest Strike: amp#x200B; It seems to be a physical attack, and the description says it also electrically charges, so does this mean it applies an electrical effect that allows the Tempest strike to do 50% more damage to shields?? Just for that one strike? (which I think is what it is) Or only subsequent attacks? Both? or not at all? and does this electrical attack do any extra separate damage # About me and the deck: Greetings CompetitiveHS, I'm IcyMirage - a casually competitive player who loves decks with lots of decision making, whether aggro, control, or combo. Warlock has been my favorite class for just about as long as HS has been out. This month I hit legend in wild with a deck that's largely nothing new - Cubelock has been around in one iteration or another since KnC blew the power level of demon based synergy out of the water. With the recent meta changes and the general. Mono Blue Tempo has been putting up results since rotation. It's shown up in every release of 5-0 decks, it's popped up in big tournament top 8s, it has won its share of PPTQs, and Gabriel Nassif took it to the top 2 of a GP. Despite that, the tone of people posting about success with the deck has been almost apologetic. It's almost like the deck doesn't cost enough for people to take it seriously. I've seen some good individual matchup analyses and high-level overviews M Credit to Kaijia for doing most of the heavy (albeit somewhat unfactual) lifting while he was my 2ic ##Policy and Joint Forces “Proudly into the future” To Ensure a Non-Gender Biased armed forces Institute a non gendered fitness test and allow women the ability to serve in the infantry if they pass the same tests as men currently do.

Hello all, this is a topic I've wanted to write about for a very long time now. This turned out to be a pretty long post, but I think it's valuable for people with CPTSD who play a lot of video games. The TL;DR is that I've had a pretty successful run of therapy so far, and I often think about why that is, and a persistent thought I have is that the video games must be doing some good. This post is about why that may be. I've been addicted to video games since I was old enough to hold a control. After logging 2 days of game play on Xbox One and reaching level 60, I wanted to give my general opinion on the current status, use and performance of the heavy weapons found in fallout 76. With multiple perks playing to the benefit of heavy weapons, I thought that they would provide an excellent platform to taking down some of the high level enemies and overall, I'd say they meet that expectation. However, after level 40, the point at which you unlock most to all of the different variants The issue is completely random. Sometimes, it freezes right away. Sometimes it's as I'm launching into a game (eg: getting into a game in Titanfall 2) or just loading anything (eg: Hero gallery in Overwatch). And usually, it's just whenever I try opening a game. Sometimes, it doesn't even happen at all. The crash is always either at the beginning of when the game is opened, in the first few minutes, or not at all. amp#x200B; The only way to get out of it is to manually reboot my computer. 
This is an attempt to predict the contents of Chapter 112 using quite a different approach from usual: "analytical" here means trying to take into account the overall narrative structure, usual storytelling mechanisms / tropes as well as Isayama's own unique writing style. Each prediction (in bold) will be explained as thoroughly as possible, and their limitations will be brought to light as well.

Hey, for the people that don’t know me, I’m Deepshades, a Warlock in Method that’s played for several years in the high end PvE scene with the Kil’jaeden World 1st kill as my biggest accomplishment.

amp#x200B; Up in the northeast area of the United States, nestled deep within the countryside, yet bordering Lake Huron sits the quaint little hunting town I'm forced to call home. I've spent a good portion of my life perusing its streets, people, and culture. It's the simple living here that makes the lifestyle seem nostalgic. No talk of politics or this years mass shooting (for the most part), just good old day to day life, set in a real, breathing world. It's been my running theory for a while that Tony Stark would be the one to wield the Infinity Gauntlet, and I wanted to make a post with all the reasons why I think it makes sense, is possible, and would also be a satisfying conclusion to not just Tony's arc, but this chapter of the MCU. Heads up, this is pretty long, but I've broken it into five main points. amp#x200B; # Point #1: Tony and Thanos are the “Big Two” The first face-to-face meeting between Thanos and Tony in Avengers:. </p>
